# Video_stitching

Video Stitching is the process of merging video frames from multiple cameras to create a seamless panoramic or composite video.
Consumer-level cameras are limited in their ability to capture wide angle panoramic videos.
Professional cameras can achieve this but are often prohibitively expensive.
The project aims to stitch multiple input videos to create a wide-angle panoramic video using affordable consumer-level cameras.
